          Hi friends, I’m writing this from my comfy seat on the plane (thanks Mom!) and can’t wait to start my new adventure! Cozy home (trips, nights next to the fireplace, & "aksjfiwkfj" with katie) was really nice but I’m looking forward to new everything for a little while.
          I’m planning to make this some sort of blog to share and document my travels every once in a while. My playlist of choice is currently “Acoustic Hits” on Spotify as I try to convince myself to go to sleep at some point. Hoping I’ll get better at journaling!
          Lots of love to everybody at home and anybody who I’m on my way to see shortly! Feeling very lucky right now!

        <h3 class="post-body">
          I’m about settled into Rotterdam, which has the cutest tram running through the city! I got here early this morning around 7am (about 1am at home) and somehow managed to stay up till 10pm. Connor was the best and met me at the airport to show me the way back to his townhouse.
          Once I dropped my stuff, we went to brunch at a great cafe (pic below)! We passed this really pretty flower shop on the way back to his house that I thought mom would love to see so I added that to the gallery for today too.
          After a quick nap, hitting the supermarket, and cooking dinner, we went to the Rotterdam Market Hall, or as they say Markthal, for a dessert called “stroopwafel” that they made fresh in a waffle iron in front of us. Amazing. Busy and great first day!

        <h3 class="post-title">Amsterdam</h3>
        <h3 class="light">Saturday, February 1st</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          For day 2, we headed to Amsterdam and really lucked out with the weather. The combined tram and train to Amsterdam took about an hour and went by really quick. We walked from the central train station through the city across canal bridges and to outer section of the city that has most of the museums, like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. On the way, we stopped in a fun sit down coffee shop (for real coffee) to help with jet lag :) Connor went to Amsterdam a few weeks ago with friends from his exchange program and was on a mission to get us a waffle near the museums.
          <br><br>
          I didn’t realize that the Netherlands is super overcast most of the time… Connor says they only get 1500 hours of sunlight in a year (8760 hours in a year), so I was so excited when the sun came out right in time for our canal cruise! For only about 20 euro, we got to go on a little boat for an hour and get a view of the city from the canals that run through it. (Katrina from church actually told me I had to do a boat tour and she was so right) I added a lot of pics from the boat tour below - so many bikes, houseboats, & cars parked right on the edge of the canal! Apparently they don’t give out moorings anymore so the space is more expensive than the boats themselves (even though one sold for 2 million this year…) We finished the night with an awesome dinner in a restaurant recommended by our tour guide that overlooked the canal and a visit to the Anne Frank house. Overall a beautiful city and a pretty awesome day 2. Think I could get used to the Netherlands :)

        <h3 class="post-body">
          Today jet lag finally caught up to me and I ended up sleeping until noon lol! Connor has an exam Monday and Tuesday, so I went with him to study in the library this afternoon for a few hours where I finished making this blog! The library at his school, Rotterdam School of Management, is pretty modern. There’s a few cafes attached and a little store nearby with all kinds of snacks :) For dinner we cooked up steaks that we bought on Friday from the butcher at the end of his block. A needed relaxing day after lots of activity this weekend!

        <h3 class="light">Monday & Tuesday, February 3rd & 4th</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          My first full week was packed! On Monday and Tuesday, Connor went to school while I played hooky and explored his cute dutch town. I really enjoyed walking through the neighborhood and browsing (expensive) clothing boutiques, getting lattes at the local coffee shop, and going shopping for snacks at the little supermarket. Locals speak dutch as their first language, so it’s always funny walking into a store and almost fitting in until I have to ask them to clarify the sales in English. The coffee shop had mini apple tarts (appeltaart), which I didn’t get to try but reminded me of home and made me think we should try making mini tarts.
          <br><br>
          After Connor’s classes on Tuesday, we went back to Markthal to check out the farmers market. It sold everything from produce to thrift clothing, to fresh fish (stay tuned for that story). For lunch I got a kind of mediterranean pizza/hot pocket combo? Don’t remember its name, but it was awesome with chicken kabob, gouda, spinach, tomatoes, and onions inside. We got a few small desserts to try fun things we had our eyes on from Friday, and Connor finally got me to try herring... yuck. As you might know, the Netherlands is very proud of their fresh herring. They serve it raw like salty sushi… below is a pic of me *before* trying it. Aside from not having the stomach for more than one bite of herring, we’re quickly becoming quite the foodies. I also luckily got a quick workout in at the school gym and ran a few kilometers to prepare for even more good food in Dublin!

        <h3 class="post-title">Dublin, Ireland!</h3>
        <h3 class="light">Wednesday, February 5th</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          After going to a cool bar that Connor’s school actually rents out for the students on Tuesday nights, we got up early on Wednesday morning for our trip to Dublin (and slept the whole flight)! We landed a little before noon, dropped our bags at the hotel, and headed out for our first Irish breakfast. Wow. Complete with a pot of Irish breakfast tea and Irish soda bread, my meal was sooo good. It was sunny and not too cold, so we walked to Trinity College and found a cool sale in one of the exam halls where they were cleaning out their previous semester’s apparel inventory so I bought a cheap cute shirt! We also saw “the Long Hall” and Book of Kells (okay you got me, the fake book because the real one was out for restoration...).
          <br><br>
          That night we found another spot near the hotel for delicious Irish food and I got my favorite meal of the trip, a cottage pie. After a long day, we were debating going on the pub crawl that we had signed up for, but went to check it out and ended up having a great time. We met a cute Australian student studying abroad in Geneva and two siblings visiting from The Netherlands and talked all night. The pub we ended in last was my favorite with a cozy upstairs and live music!

        <h3 class="post-title">Touring Dublin</h3>
        <h3 class="light">Thursday, February 6th</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          For our full day on Thursday, we started with another Irish breakfast, complimentary with the hotel, and went on a free walking tour of the city. Our tour guide ended up being a pretty funny young guy who had an Irish accent and full ginger beard. Over the course of about 3 hours, I had my first Irish coffee, learned that Ireland has been an independent country for less than 100 years, and got roasted by the guide for being American a few times. When we visited the old king’s palace, he pointed out that all of the doors were a bright blue. It turns out Saint Patrick traditionally wore bright blue, but when Americans took on St Patrick’s Day as their own holiday they wrongly associated it with the classic Irish green in the flag and countryside. Overall a solid tour.
          <br><br>
          That afternoon we visited the Guinness brewery, learned how to properly pour a Guinness and got a great view of the city from the newly opened “Gravity Bar” on the top floor. As a bonus, we ended up meeting up and catching up with Connor’s roommate at Michigan for the past 2 years, Sam, for dinner at none other than the Hairy Lemon!
          <br><br>
          But wait, funny story. The night before, at the end of our pub crawl in the upstairs back little room of a random pub, my phone fell on the ground (oops) and a girl behind us saw my Michigan ID in my phone case. Turns out not only was she a Michigan student studying abroad in Dublin, but she was from Chatham NJ and I played soccer against her and went to ISTC sleep away camp with her in middle school! Haha my first abroad it’s a crazy small world experience. She knew Connor’s Michigan roommate and helped us remember to meet up with him!

          Friday was another needed lowkey day, and I slept in (while classic Connor went for a run, but turns out he’ll drink beer if it’s actually good beer!) We toured very pretty Saint Patrick’s Cathedral and I thought of Dad when I saw that they needed money for both a new organ and new slate roof (ha, double ha, haha)! After a final Irish meal, this time fish and chips, seafood chowder, and a red ale (expanding my beer knowledge) we got a taxi to the airport. I tried to meet up with Ellie McCarthy who is studying at Trinity but just missed her because she’d actually headed to Amsterdam for the weekend lol. Just caught up writing about my great week on the hour plane ride back to the Netherlands (listening to “hooked” and vibing to Hosier). Looking forward to another day with Connor before I have to actually be a student again. Sláinte! (Irish for cheers!)
