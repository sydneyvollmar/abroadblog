          Hi friends, I’m writing this from my comfy seat on the plane (thanks Mom!) and can’t wait to start my new adventure! Cozy home (trips, nights next to the fireplace, & "aksjfiwkfj" with katie) was really nice but I’m looking forward to new everything for a little while.
          I’m planning to make this some sort of blog to share and document my travels every once in a while. My playlist of choice is currently “Acoustic Hits” on Spotify as I try to convince myself to go to sleep at some point. Hoping I’ll get better at journaling!
          Lots of love to everybody at home and anybody who I’m on my way to see shortly! Feeling very lucky right now!

        <h3 class="post-body">
          I’m about settled into Rotterdam, which has the cutest tram running through the city! I got here early this morning around 7am (about 1am at home) and somehow managed to stay up till 10pm. Connor was the best and met me at the airport to show me the way back to his townhouse.
          Once I dropped my stuff, we went to brunch at a great cafe (pic below)! We passed this really pretty flower shop on the way back to his house that I thought mom would love to see so I added that to the gallery for today too.
          After a quick nap, hitting the supermarket, and cooking dinner, we went to the Rotterdam Market Hall, or as they say Markthal, for a dessert called “stroopwafel” that they made fresh in a waffle iron in front of us. Amazing. Busy and great first day!

        <h3 class="post-title">Amsterdam</h3>
        <h3 class="light">Saturday, February 1st</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          For day 2, we headed to Amsterdam and really lucked out with the weather. The combined tram and train to Amsterdam took about an hour and went by really quick. We walked from the central train station through the city across canal bridges and to outer section of the city that has most of the museums, like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. On the way, we stopped in a fun sit down coffee shop (for real coffee) to help with jet lag :) Connor went to Amsterdam a few weeks ago with friends from his exchange program and was on a mission to get us a waffle near the museums.
          <br><br>
          I didn’t realize that the Netherlands is super overcast most of the time… Connor says they only get 1500 hours of sunlight in a year (8760 hours in a year), so I was so excited when the sun came out right in time for our canal cruise! For only about 20 euro, we got to go on a little boat for an hour and get a view of the city from the canals that run through it. (Katrina from church actually told me I had to do a boat tour and she was so right) I added a lot of pics from the boat tour below - so many bikes, houseboats, & cars parked right on the edge of the canal! Apparently they don’t give out moorings anymore so the space is more expensive than the boats themselves (even though one sold for 2 million this year…) We finished the night with an awesome dinner in a restaurant recommended by our tour guide that overlooked the canal and a visit to the Anne Frank house. Overall a beautiful city and a pretty awesome day 2. Think I could get used to the Netherlands :)

          Today jet lag finally caught up to me and I ended up sleeping until noon lol! Connor has an exam Monday and Tuesday, so I went with him to study in the library this afternoon for a few hours where I finished making this blog! The library at his school, Rotterdam School of Management, is pretty modern. There’s a few cafes attached and a little store nearby with all kinds of snacks :) For dinner we cooked up steaks that we bought on Friday from the butcher at the end of his block. A needed relaxing day after lots of activity this weekend!

        <h3 class="light">Monday & Tuesday, February 3rd & 4th</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          My first full week was packed! On Monday and Tuesday, Connor went to school while I played hooky and explored his cute dutch town. I really enjoyed walking through the neighborhood and browsing (expensive) clothing boutiques, getting lattes at the local coffee shop, and going shopping for snacks at the little supermarket. Locals speak dutch as their first language, so it’s always funny walking into a store and almost fitting in until I have to ask them to clarify the sales in English. The coffee shop had mini apple tarts (appeltaart), which I didn’t get to try but reminded me of home and made me think we should try making mini tarts.
          <br><br>
          After Connor’s classes on Tuesday, we went back to Markthal to check out the farmers market. It sold everything from produce to thrift clothing, to fresh fish (stay tuned for that story). For lunch I got a kind of mediterranean pizza/hot pocket combo? Don’t remember its name, but it was awesome with chicken kabob, gouda, spinach, tomatoes, and onions inside. We got a few small desserts to try fun things we had our eyes on from Friday, and Connor finally got me to try herring... yuck. As you might know, the Netherlands is very proud of their fresh herring. They serve it raw like salty sushi… below is a pic of me *before* trying it. Aside from not having the stomach for more than one bite of herring, we’re quickly becoming quite the foodies. I also luckily got a quick workout in at the school gym and ran a few kilometers to prepare for even more good food in Dublin!

        <h3 class="light">Wednesday, February 5th</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          After going to a cool bar that Connor’s school actually rents out for the students on Tuesday nights, we got up early on Wednesday morning for our trip to Dublin (and slept the whole flight)! We landed a little before noon, dropped our bags at the hotel, and headed out for our first Irish breakfast. Wow. Complete with a pot of Irish breakfast tea and Irish soda bread, my meal was sooo good. It was sunny and not too cold, so we walked to Trinity College and found a cool sale in one of the exam halls where they were cleaning out their previous semester’s apparel inventory so I bought a cheap cute shirt! We also saw “the Long Hall” and Book of Kells (okay you got me, the fake book because the real one was out for restoration...).
          <br><br>
          That night we found another spot near the hotel for delicious Irish food and I got my favorite meal of the trip, a cottage pie. After a long day, we were debating going on the pub crawl that we had signed up for, but went to check it out and ended up having a great time. We met a cute Australian student studying abroad in Geneva and two siblings visiting from The Netherlands and talked all night. The pub we ended in last was my favorite with a cozy upstairs and live music!

        <h3 class="light">Thursday, February 6th</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          For our full day on Thursday, we started with another Irish breakfast, complimentary with the hotel, and went on a free walking tour of the city. Our tour guide ended up being a pretty funny young guy who had an Irish accent and full ginger beard. Over the course of about 3 hours, I had my first Irish coffee, learned that Ireland has been an independent country for less than 100 years, and got roasted by the guide for being American a few times. When we visited the old king’s palace, he pointed out that all of the doors were a bright blue. It turns out Saint Patrick traditionally wore bright blue, but when Americans took on St Patrick’s Day as their own holiday they wrongly associated it with the classic Irish green in the flag and countryside. Overall a solid tour.
          <br><br>
          That afternoon we visited the Guinness brewery, learned how to properly pour a Guinness and got a great view of the city from the newly opened “Gravity Bar” on the top floor. As a bonus, we ended up meeting up and catching up with Connor’s roommate at Michigan for the past 2 years, Sam, for dinner at none other than the Hairy Lemon!
          <br><br>
          But wait, funny story. The night before, at the end of our pub crawl in the upstairs back little room of a random pub, my phone fell on the ground (oops) and a girl behind us saw my Michigan ID in my phone case. Turns out not only was she a Michigan student studying abroad in Dublin, but she was from Chatham NJ and I played soccer against her and went to ISTC sleep away camp with her in middle school! Haha my first abroad it’s a crazy small world experience. She knew Connor’s Michigan roommate and helped us remember to meet up with him!

          Friday was another needed lowkey day, and I slept in (while classic Connor went for a run, but turns out he’ll drink beer if it’s actually good beer!) We toured very pretty Saint Patrick’s Cathedral and I thought of Dad when I saw that they needed money for both a new organ and new slate roof (ha, double ha, haha)! After a final Irish meal, this time fish and chips, seafood chowder, and a red ale (expanding my beer knowledge) we got a taxi to the airport. I tried to meet up with Ellie McCarthy who is studying at Trinity but just missed her because she’d actually headed to Amsterdam for the weekend lol. Just caught up writing about my great week on the hour plane ride back to the Netherlands (listening to “hooked” and vibing to Hosier). Looking forward to another day with Connor before I have to actually be a student again. Sláinte! (Irish for cheers!)

I arrived in Prague last night around 7pm and my student buddy nicely drove me on the scenic route to my dorm from the airport, but I didn’t get to see much. So this morning walking out of my building and taking the tram right to school was so cool. My dorm is about 15 minutes away from the school by tram and my school is about 15 minutes from the city center by tram, making everything feel pretty easy to get to but far enough that you have to kind of set out to go somewhere.
          <br><br>
          I’m on the 10th floor, so my room has a nice view of some cute czech red rooftops which are a pretty well known symbol of the city. I’m in a double room attached to another double room by a kitchen common area with a little table and to a shared bathroom. Although I wish we had a little couch or something to make the common area more homey, I’m really happy that my room is clean and actually pretty big and I’m even more happy to finally be settled in. My suite-mates are also really nice. One of them has been on exchange since the fall semester, so she helped us get a tram ticket and to campus and orientation and everything today.
          <br><br>
          My favorite part of today was exploring just a little past the school and finding a cute coffee shop with my friend from Michigan and a few new friends, including my suite mate :) Check out my cute "London Fog", tea steeped with steamed milk and a timer to make sure it steeps long enough haha. I have orientation for VSE the rest of this week still, but I can’t wait to go see the center of the city in Prague 1 sometime soon. Also haven’t gotten the chance to eat a traditional Czech meal yet, but I had some pretty bomb bbq for dinner (I know bbq in Prague is sad but needed some trusted/awesome food) and I saw a few more of my business frat brothers (Peter + Anna + Ellie + Kevin) :) PGN takes Prague. So overall a great day and still figuring everything out of course. Yay!

        <h3 class="light">Thursday, February 13th</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          This week I walked around my neighborhood a little more and figured out that I'm in a pretty residential area (which is nice and quiet). I always feel pretty safe and its nice that the tram drops us off 100m away from the dorm's front door. Everything is super organized here, so the public transportation system runs super well. So far I've taken the tram, the metro, and the bus to get wherever I'm trying to go with friends.
          <br><br>
          I also might have a coffee addiction when I get home, because I drink at least a latte a day here. I love that they're pretty cheap but I also like that they give me the chance to find cool new cafes to post up shop in for a little while. After orientation yesterday, I went to lunch with my suite mates at Soul Chicken, a Korean place one of them really liked, and then took the tram further into the city. I stopped by Tim’s apartment to check it out and say hi on the way to my coffee shop of the day. It’s been really nice having people here that I already know that live further away so that I can go see them when I want to but don’t spend everyday with them. I also didn’t realize that as you get closer to Old Town, the streets are super confusing and I took a wrong turn and actually ended up right in Old Town Square, which was beautiful at night.
          <br><br>
          Today, I toured around the city a little more with Peter (PGN friend) and then went on a brewery tour of one of the last family owned breweries left in the country. Their beer is so fresh it’s pumped right from the basement up to the restaurant, which is the only place it’s served. I finished off the day with my first traditional Czech meal, goulash! It was a good meal because we were really hungry, but I don’t know if I’ll be ordering it too often. Some of my friends are already off to Budapest for the weekend, so I’m planning to go explore more when the weather’s nice this weekend!

          Today I'd planned to go to the top of the "Prague Eiffel Tower" called the Petrin Tower, but ended up missing the tram to get me there before dark. Instead, I caught the tram to Prague 1, which takes you into the center of the city, and found a cute path leading down to the water.
          <br><br>
          I actually had perfect timing and caught the sunset just right. Since it's Valentine's Weekend, I've noticed that there are more tourists than usual, and it seemed like they all had the same idea to wander along the riverbank. This was one of my favorite accidental moments so far and I was so happy I'd brought my camera just in case!

          Life finally picked up here and I’ve been kept pretty busy going to class Mon-Wed and exploring Thurs-Sun. My first week of classes went really well and I was so excited to meet new people. I made friends with a super cute Italian girl, Chiara, in my “Web 2.0” class, and we’re building a website together (another one jeez) for our final project. She introduced me to her Italian and French friends and we all went out to a big Italian dinner (or the best pizza they said they could find in Prague). This is me and Chiara at dinner. So fun!

        <h3 class="post-body">
          This week I felt like I still didn’t know much about the historic parts of Prague, so I booked a free walking tour early Saturday morning. It was a beautiful sunny day and I liked getting to see Old Town, New Town, and the Jewish Quarter. I shopped around the city center and found a great street market with cute little souvenirs, I’m thinking I’ll go back there at the end of the program to buy some memorabilia.
          <br><br>
          The rest of the day was completely unplanned, but I ended up joining Chiara and friends at a huge park in Prague 2 (on the other side of the river). We had fun wandering through it, fooling around and eventually came across this giant pop-up carnival. I was so happy when everybody in the group was into it, and we payed a few crowns to get in and all 8 of us did 2 rounds of bumper cars (to switch the drivers obviously). One of the most important parts of today was my first chimney cake!! I got it hollow with just nutella so it wasn’t too heavy... big fan. Was worried about not having plans this weekend and staying home to explore ended up being very worth it!

          My friend from Michigan, who's also studying here, found out about this company that creates scavenger hunts for landmarks through famous cities. They wanted to do a test run for the hunt in Prague and we tried it out for them today! Prague 3 is the part of the city that I live in, so I was excited to get to see more of the much less touristy part of the city. Pics include a very cool park we found, the largest clock in the Czech Republic (very communist looking), and what I believe was the old radio tower and now is for getting a good view of the city.

        <h3 class="post-body">
          What a good weekend! For my first trip since settling into Prague, I traveled to London to meet up with my Michigan a cappella friends! I stayed with Maddie in her dorm at Queen Mary University in Mile End. We took “the tube” (cool) into the center of the city and she was such a nice tour guide showing me some museums, Buckingham Palace, Tower Bridge, and the London Eye all in the first day.
          <br><br>
          The next day we met up with Kate and Emma (also from a cappella) who had flew in from Spain to join us! We went to Borough Market which had stands of cheese, meat, and dessert as far as I could see. We all got lunch  and Kate and I got amazing noodles and dumplings. For dessert Maddie showed us her favorite bakery stand and we all got fresh donuts. Omg. My favorite part of London was definitely discovering that Westminster Abbey was holding an Evensong service on Saturday afternoon. All of us a cappella nerds went to hear the choir sing and it was really beautiful. That night for dinner and drinks we met up with yet another a cappella member, Loren, who is a year younger than us and had come over for spring break. So so much fun we could all make it to see her! Got welcomed by a rainbow when I landed back in Prague :) Can I do this whole travel the world thing forever please?

        <h3 class="post-body">
          Now that it’s already the third week of classes, it’s interesting to see the teaching styles of the different professors. My professors are all Czech and it’s been really refreshing hearing the subjects taught from their point of view. My courses are Web 2.0, Information Systems Management, Entrepreneurship of SMEs, New Media and Social Network Services, Information in Policy, and Bitcoin in Business. There’s also one other student at VSE from the School of Information at Michigan and it’s really nice that we’re in most of the same classes together.
          <br><br>
          My favorite class so far is probably Bitcoin in Business just because of how unique it is. For this week’s class, we had a class flea market where everyone bought and sold things with bitcoin. One of my classmates actually went so far as to brew different types of coffee and bring them to class, calling it his “coffee coin bar.” Thought it was so funny. There’s also a cafe in Prague that only accepts bitcoin as payment, so I’ll probably end up there a few times now that I’m the proud owner of 10 whole dollars worth of bitcoin.

        <h3 class="post-body">
          Barcelona is absolutely beautiful. With temps in about the high 60s most of my visit, I got to explore the city with my best friends. It was so fun that not only Connor, Muskaan, Cam, Tim, and Garrett were all in barce for the weekend but so many more of PGN ended up there too this weekend. I was one of the first friends to get to Spain on Thursday afternoon, so I got to tour around and catch up with Muskaan for a few hours. She’s studying there and has really learned her way around, bringing us to her favorite roof top bar next to the Cathedral at sunset for some amazing sangria. When Connor got in (from Rome cause he’s stubborn) that night, we went to dinner on the beach and had hands down the best paella of the trip (and more delicious sangria... see a trend).
          <br><br>
          The next few days consisted of all of us learning about each other’s past few months while hitting amazing sights like Citadel Park and Arc De Triomf. Since Michigan was still on spring break, a lot of people were in Spain and I happened to run into another one of my really good a cappella friends while we were wandering around the park! This city had so many good opportunities for pictures, so the guys made sure I took plenty of them haha. The best part was wandering around and watching everyone thrive stress free abroad. At one point we even ended up in a row boat on a lake, where Tim and Garrett really tested whether that two people could row a boat at the same time. Gorgeous views continued at the Bunkers for sunset with some wine (just rose not sangria but we had that again at dinner yay). Important part of the day that I forgot to mention was churros con chocolate!! Sooo good. Not sure how Mom studied in Spain, I feel like I’d eat churros every single day. An amazing trip, and staying right on Las Ramblas helped really feel like we didn’t miss any of the action. Almost didn’t have Barcelona on my schedule abroad and now so glad I went for it. Ended up being a beautiful last mini trip.

          The hardest part about leaving was how fast it happened. It seemed like every few hours we had new news to deal with, whether it was my friends from Italy worrying about their family trapped at home or my friends traveling for the weekend who didn’t know if they’d be able to make it back into the Czech Republic. We’d take bets everyday to try to figure out how long each program would be there and as of Sunday night I thought I probably had until at least the end of March.
          <br><br>
          When I found out that I had 24 hours left in Prague, I tuned into my online class for about an hour and then decided to finish as much of my Prague bucket list as possible. My roommates were so nice when I told them about my plan to adventure all day because the three of them immediately offered to join me. On my last day I finally saw the panoramic views from the top of the TV tower, climbed Zizkov Hill to see the views from the statue, visited the moving Kafka head display, got to the Lennon Wall, walked Charles Bridge one last time (and bought a painting from one of the artists on the bridge), saw the “Dancing House”, and got another Tredelnik (chimney cake). I finished off the day with sushi with my Michigan friends (Cam’s choice lol) and a Czech beer with my international friends &lt;3
          <br><br>
          I really loved Prague’s smaller, more intimate feel compared to London and Barcelona and appreciated that I always felt completely safe when taking the trams or walking around. Between the winding cobblestone streets that had me walking in circles around the Old Town and the beautiful castle lit up as we took the tram home at night, I always felt like Prague had a lot of character. Although I have at least a few things on my list to do when I eventually go back and I have a few czech sayings that I’ll miss using to order my coffees, I am so so happy with my month in Prague. Until then na shledanou! good bye!
