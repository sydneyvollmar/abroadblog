          Hi friends, I’m writing this from my very comfy seat on the plane (thanks Mom!) and can’t wait to start my new adventure! Cozy home (trips, fires, aksjfiwkfj with katie) was really really nice but I’m looking forward to new everything for a little while.
          I’m planning to make this some sort of blog to share and document my travels every once in a while. My playlist of choice is currently “Acoustic Hits” on Spotify as I try to convince myself to go to sleep at some point. Hoping I’ll get better at journaling!
          Lots of love to everybody at home and anybody who I’m on my way to see shortly! Feeling very lucky right now!

        <h3 class="post-body">
          I’m about settled into Rotterdam, which has the cutest tram running through the city! I got here early this morning around 7am (about 1am at home) and somehow managed to stay up till 10pm. Connor was the best and met me at the airport to show me the way back to his townhouse.
          Once I dropped my stuff, we went to brunch at a great cafe (pic below)! We passed this really pretty flower shop on the way back to his house that I thought mom would love to see so I added that to the gallery for today too.
          After a quick nap, hitting the supermarket, and cooking dinner, we went to the Rotterdam Market Hall, or as they say Markthal, for a dessert called “stroopwafel” that they made fresh in a waffle iron in front of us. Amazing. Busy and great first day!

        <h3 class="post-title">Amsterdam</h3>
        <h3 class="light">Saturday, February 1st</h3>
        <h3 class="post-body">
          For day 2, we headed to Amsterdam and really lucked out with the weather. The combined tram and train to Amsterdam took about an hour and went by really quick. We walked from the central train station through the city across canal bridges and to outer section of the city that has most of the museums, like the Rijksmuseum and Van Gogh Museum. On the way, we stopped in a fun sit down coffee shop (for real coffee) to help with jet lag :) Connor went to Amsterdam a few weeks ago with friends from his exchange program and was on a mission to get us a waffle near the museums.
          <br><br>
          I didn’t realize that the Netherlands is super overcast most of the time… Connor says they only get 1500 hours of sunlight in a year (8760 hours in a year), so I was so excited when the sun came out right in time for our canal cruise! For only about 20 euro, we got to go on a little boat for an hour and get a view of the city from the canals that run through it. (Katrina from church actually told me I had to do a boat tour and she was so right) I added a lot of pics from the boat tour below - so many bikes, houseboats, & cars parked right on the edge of the canal! Apparently they don’t give out moorings anymore so the space is more expensive than the boats themselves (even though one sold for 2 million this year…) We finished the night with an awesome dinner in a restaurant recommended by our tour guide that overlooked the canal and a visit to the Anne Frank house. Overall a beautiful city and a pretty awesome day 2. Think I could get used to the Netherlands :)

        <h3 class="post-body">
          Today jet lag finally caught up to me and I ended up sleeping until noon lol! Connor has an exam Monday and Tuesday, so I went with him to study in the library this afternoon for a few hours where I finished making this blog! The library at his school, Rotterdam School of Management, is pretty modern. There’s a few cafes attached and a little store nearby with all kinds of snacks :) For dinner we cooked up steaks that we bought on Friday from the butcher at the end of his block. A needed relaxing day after lots of activity this weekend!
